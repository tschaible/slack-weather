slack-weather is a node.js REST server which can be used to back slack custom slash weather and forecast commands that utilize the openweathermap.org API and other sources.

In other words, within slack ... type `/weather 12345` to get the weather at zip code 12345, type `/forecast 12345` to get the 5 day forecast at zip code 12345 


##The Commands

###/weather zipcode [C/F]
Get the current weather for a `zipcode` and optionally specify C or F

Source: openweathermap.org

###/forecast zipcode [C/F]
Get the 5-day forecast for a `zipcode` and optionally specify C or F

Source: openweathermap.org

###/radar zipcode
Get a radar gif attachment for `zipcode`

If you omit zipcode, it will show the US weather map

Source: weather.gov

## Running the Server
```
OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY=[apiKey] npm start
```
where `[apiKey]` is a valid openweathmap.org API key.  

The server will listen on all interfaces and port 3000 by default.



To specify an alternate, such as 'localhost' and port 8080, run as follows
```
OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY=[apiKey] PORT=8080 SERVER_HOST=localhost npm start
```
where `[apiKey]` is a valid openweathmap.org API key.  


##Running with Docker
The application can be run using docker.  Simply run the following:
```
docker run -d -e OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY=<apiKey> -p 3000:3000 tschaible/slack-weather:latest
```
This will build the Docker image as tschaible/slack-weather and run it, listening on the host machine's port 3000
